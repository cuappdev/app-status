# AppDev Status Platform
This repository contains the code for AppDev's very own status platform, designed to showcase which of our apps are currently down, in maintenance, and up and running. The platform also allows users to subscribe to receive updates whenever an app's status changes.

## Getting Started
Navigate to the `backend/` directory to view instructions on how to run the project backend. The frontend is built in Next.js and can be started using the standard Next command (via `yarn start` or `yarn dev`). You should also update the backend url in the `frontend/constants.ts` to point the local backend process on your computer when running the project locally.
